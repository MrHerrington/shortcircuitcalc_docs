Simplify calculation the electrical system parameters
=====================================================

The program calculates the parameters of the power supply system (at the moment short circuit currents),
and also provides a built-in browser for managing the electrical equipment catalog database.

Modules and technologies used:
    - technologies:
        - python;
        - SQL;
        - databases administration (MySQL, SQLite);
        - Qt Designer;
        - GUI optimization (graphics mapping blitting, multithreading operations).
    - modules:
        - CairoSVG;
        - matplotlib;
        - numpy;
        - pandas;
        - PyQt5;
        - sphinx;
        - SQLAlchemy.

Graphics engine of this program used CairoSVG module.
CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo. It can export SVG files to PDF, EPS, PS, and PNG files.

Requirements for correctly working CairoSVG module (successful testing on Windows 10 64 bit):
    - | GTK+ for Windows Runtime Environment Installer (fork from http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net)
      | (watch https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer latest release);
    - | UniConvertor 2.0 Release Candidate 5 (RC5)
      | (watch https://sk1project.net/uc2/download/).
